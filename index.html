                    <p><b>Christopher George Latore Wallace</b> (May 21, 1972 - March 9, 1997), better known by his stage names the Notorious B.I.G., Biggie Smalls, or simply Biggie, was an American rapper and songwriter. Rooted in the New York rap scene and gangsta rap traditions, he is widely considered one of the greatest rappers of all time. Wallace became known for his distinctive laid-back lyrical delivery, offsetting the lyrics' often grim content. His music was often semi-autobiographical, telling of hardship and criminality, but also of debauchery and celebration.</p>

                    The album made him the central figure in East Coast hip hop, 
                    and restored New York's visibility at a time when the West Coast hip hop scene was dominating hip hop music.</p>

              <li><h4 class="date">1996 </h4><p>while recording his second album, Wallace became ensnarled in the escalating East Coast-West Coast hip hop feud. 
                Following Tupac Shakur's death in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas in September 1996, 
                speculations of involvement in Shakur's murder 
                by criminal elements orbiting the Bad Boy circle circulated as a result of Wallace's public feud with Shakur.</p> 
            </li>
            <li><h4 class="date">1997 </h4><p>On March 9, six months after Shakur's death, 
                Wallace was murdered in a drive-by shooting while visiting Los Angeles.
